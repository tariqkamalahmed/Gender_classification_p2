"...All I'm saying is it'salright to feel hopeless.  OK.Look. You're at an age when you're starting to have your own thoughts - about the world, about who you are. But it's important to remember Lucy, these are just thoughts. When I was your age, if I wanted to let off some steam, do you know what I used to do.  I used to put my headphones on and I'd jump to some music. It's called pogoing.","IAN","male"
"No, you're alright.  I should be getting off actually.  Bye girls.","TANYA","female"

"Oh you are joking.  I haven't done silver service since the Meal Machine.  What about you?","IAN","male"
"Like how many affairs he's really had?","JANE","female"
"It's more than that. It's mroe than that.  It's like he knows what I'm thinking. It's like he knows what I'm gonna do next. Maybe...","TANYA","female"

"I might be wrong.  I hope I am.  But I don't think so.","HEATHER","female"

"I'm taking it.   Cos Steven needs to be at his job.","JANE","female"
"Well you'll see me unhappy and all if you keep moving.Look, tell me something. Why are you helping me? You didn't have to.","STACEY","female"

I loved you with all my heart ... and now ... even now ... there's still something there. How disgusting is that?  To still have feelings like that. But not you though eh?  Not you. The only person you love is yourself ... is Max Branning ... king of the world ain't he? That's what you tell yourself. I know the truth, inside you‚re just, you're just a frightened, sad, lonely little boy, frightened kid who's dad didn't love him enough. And it's all... it's all so pathetic.I just don't care any more. I don't care what happens to me.  You ... you've broken me.  I've got nothing left. I just... I just don't care ...","TANYA","female"
"Alright then, why?  Why you doing it?","SEAN","male"
"Thought you were going to join me in the shower?","MAX","male"

"I'm not his skivvy...","IAN","male"
"She'll waltz back when school's out, pretend she's had a hard day. Look. I'm all for treating the kids like adults, Ian.  But after this, you've got to lay down the law.","JANE","female"

"‚Course.","JANE","female"
"He wouldn't.  That slimy little... He has been lording it over me all day! The arrogant little... Nah, he's not gonna get away with this.","TANYA","female"

"Like I said, something was missing.I've spent a lot of time these last couple of weeks being scared...and angry...  But, you know what? It doesn't matter. None of it. Not really.  All that matters is sitting here, round this table.","JANE","female"

"Just go. Please get out!","SHIRLEY","female"
"Yeah I'm positive.","RONNIE","female"

"Why would you even buy it though?","RONNIE","female"
"And besides, even","JACK","male"
"Just telling you what I saw.","JACK","male"
"No I like to know what I'm getting in to before I make that kind of commitment.","RONNIE","female"
"Did it do the trick? Bet she loved it.","SHIRLEY","female"
"I know. It's exhausting innit.  It's all this stress. But it's all sorted now, innit. And that is why I'm taking you out for a fancy meal tonight. Champagne. Posh frock the whole lot.","MAX","male"

"You're twenty two years old - you got no dependants - you think I just fell out of the pram.","MAX","male"
"I do.  I mean I would.","GARRY","male"
"I chose you for a reason, Darren.  You're ambitious, motivated and you've got a world of guts - not many people would've agreed to take Phil Mitchell on.  But you need to prove to me you can live with the pressure of the choices you make.  Do that, and you'll be owning a lot more than a crappy car lot in a few years time.   See, what I'm offering you here, is an apprenticeship.  If you can't handle it just say so now.  I'll give you some money, you can head off, start again somewhere else.  Or you can accept the risk, stay here, and learn how to really play the game.  It's up to you.  That or this.  What are you going to do?","JACK","male"

"I thought I'd save you the trouble of carrying it down the stairs.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Well, it's right isn't it?","IAN","male"
"Minty, the intricacies of the female friendship are a mystery mate.  They're not governed by any sort of logic, that is why it's impossible to try and understand them.  I mean you take Lynn and her sisters right, one minute they'd be screaming blue murder, the next doing each others make-up!","GARRY","male"
"You think you can keep it from them?","SHIRLEY","female"
"No, tonight. Right, Max has got some business drinks. I'll find a way alright...","TANYA","female"
"If I were you, I'd keep me onside at the moment, cos I can go in there and say anything.","SHIRLEY","female"

"In the dusters bag.","ROXY","female"
"This what it's going to be like in court? Just One lie after another.  I hope they do flaming hang you.","TANYA","female"
"You killed someone?I can't... I mean... what does that feel like?","TANYA","female"
"Well, he's in a good mood.","RONNIE","female"
"That's a good idea, innit.  We'll get all the local movers and shakers together, mix a bit of business and pleasure.","TANYA","female"
"Well if you find it that funny I'll stick a few more in.","STACEY","female"

"Why you so worried about what she thinks.","JACK","male"
"So are you two an item then?  Are you going to keep seeing him?","ROXY","female"
"It's the kids that suffer when parents split, it's not fair to use them as weapons. You had an affair, it's just sex, isn't it?  It's not like anyone died.   I tell you what, if I got married I'd be awful - so unfaithful. Just as well I'm single, eh? I'll see myself out.","CLARE","female"
"That hurt.","MINTY","male"
"No fuss?","JANE","female"

"Why would you?","TANYA","female"
"And?","CLARE","female"
"He thinks it's ‚cool', less stuffy than a hotel. All we had to do was cancel the band, book a DJ, work up a buffet menu...","CHRISTIAN","male"

"It's the attic.","JACK","male"
"I'll think of someone.","SEAN","male"
"You asked me to try the dress on.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Oh ha ha, what about the fillings?","IAN","male"
"You disappointed?","JACK","male"
"What?","STACEY","female"
"If that was true he would have already done it, wouldn't he.  Look he's got everything he wants. He's back here, he's got his home, his family -","SEAN","male"

"Nah. I think you were right the first time. Me and Tan...  it's too late.Hello?","MAX","male"
"Now you listen to me. You might think you know what you're dealing with but you don't. Right, Sean ain't like normal people. You can't just wind him up not expect him not to blow. Because he will. And when he does. It ain't gonna be pretty. Now Tayna please, I am asking you... I'm asking you nicely, to just leave my brother alone. It ain't gonna make you happy, it ain't gonna make the girls happy. It ain't gonna help anyone.","STACEY","female"
"I was expecting Ronnie.","JACK","male"

"I know what I'm doing Auntie Peg.","RONNIE","female"
"Bradley. Apparently someone complained and--","STACEY","female"
"Alright. That's enough. Listen. I know what you're all thinking, but Max is the Father of my kids. We could have walked away, split everything in two but we didn't because...Because we've got something special. Something I'll never find again in my life and I'm not going to let that go.So if we're all going to be friends I want the digs to stop, you know. Cos he's my man. And I'm his girl. And none of us know what goes on behind closed doors, do we? I mean we talk. He's told me things... things he's never told anyone before - not even his own brother.","TANYA","female"
"I want to talk to you about Sean.","MAX","male"
"That not look real to you?","SHIRLEY","female"
"I felt so proud...  That I was gonna be someone's dad...  i'd have been a good dad too. I felt special, worthwhile...Like I'd finally achieved something with my life...","MINTY","male"

"No that was the only one. It took pride of place on the mantelpiece in the living room, that did.  He used to polish it every Sunday after lunch.    Suppose  he could've been big, he was certainly handy enough with his fists, but he didn't have much discipline. But I remember, you know, every now and again when he had money riding on a fight, he'd go down to the gym.  I remember, me and Grant, we'd be sitting there watching him, you know sparing with the other boxers. Quiet as mice we'd be. That's how we learnt.

"What are you doing here?","RONNIE","female"
"I hope so, see you later, bye.","TANYA","female"
"You know, Ian, you're exactly as I imagined.  Did I say, Ash?  The kind of bloke Jane would end up marrying? I mean David was always going to be a tough act to follow, but my word, I think she's found him.","CHRISTIAN","male"

"Sit down babe, we've got some bad news...","MAX","male"

"It was only supposed to be a bit of fun.","CLARE","female"
"Look when things went wrong between me and Selina -  There was a lot of unfinished business, a lot of arguing.  That wasn't good, for any of us. Least of all Penny. I agreed to keep my distance.","JACK","male"
"Took you long enough.","ROXY","female"
"Come on.","SEAN","male"
"Well, I'd be married to Damian. Wondering what the hell went wrong with my life. You saved me from that.","ROXY","female"
"I Love you.","TANYA","female"
"Now you listen to me. Do you ever want us to have sex again?  Because that's the choice you're making here.","JANE","female"
"Maybe we should ask the girls what they want.","MAX","male"
"You're joking?","JANE","female"
"You see?  Do you honestly think I'd let her anywhere near my kids if I didn't trust her - one hundred per cent?","TANYA","female"
"What?","IAN","male"
"No.","TANYA","female"
"Mm. Sounds like you didn't expect it, which makes it exactly the right time.  You see it's all a matter of trust isn't it?","RONNIE","female"
"You hit someone?","TANYA","female"
"Just ignore it.  It'll go away. I told them, we don't want to be disturbed.","IAN","male"
"He popped out.","ROXY","female"
"Do we?","RONNIE","female"
"We need to get out of here. Now. Come on.","SEAN","male"

"That must have been tough.","MINTY","male"
"Oh did he?  Always said he was a soft touch.","STACEY","female"
"Just catching up on a bit of work.","MINTY","male"
"So what did you think? You were gonna find some conveniently incriminating evidence? You've been watching too much television Roxanne.","JACK","male"
"Or what?  You'll hit me an' all?  I might not be as restrained as Jack.  It's just...It doesn't make any sense.  He found Louise for you...","RONNIE","female"
"I wasn't sure.  But now?  Yes, too right I am.  At least til you lot can start being civil to him - you're the ones with the problem here, not Jack.","RONNIE","female"
"I'm soaked.","SHIRLEY","female"
"I have plenty of issues with Christian, but him being gay isn't one of them.","JANE","female"

"Yeah but you didn't, did you? You left that one to me.","ROXY","female"
"Absinthe? You got any idea how strong that stuff is? You just gonna leave it around for my kids to drink, are you?","MAX","male"
"Phil, what are you drinking?","JACK","male"
"He'd find us.","TANYA","female"
"OK. Soon as I move back in, I'll do it then.","MAX","male"
"Can I top you up?","CHRISTIAN","male"
"Why is it?  You knew what you were risking.  Your marriage.  Your children's happiness, peace of mind - but you did it anyway.","TANYA","female"
"What does that mean?","MINTY","male"
"Yeah well I still need my dressing gown.","RONNIE","female"
"So you won't mind if he stays for a week or two?","JANE","female"
"Didn't think you'd stitch me up like that.","SHIRLEY","female"
"I knew she was in there. You were just hiding her from me but my instincts are never wrong.I take it that's my cue to go then?","SEAN","male"
"No thanks. I know what you mean by a night out.","JANE","female"
"Oh, did you get a selection?","IAN","male"
"It's important.","TANYA","female"
"Have you noticed anything....a little bit different...about her lately?","MINTY","male"
"Not today.","TANYA","female"
"Come on, tonights supposed to be a bit of fun.  Why don't you get into the spirit!","RONNIE","female"
"That's what I would have done though.  If I'd been her.  I'd be waiting on the dock right now, hoping you knew how much I loved you.","HEATHER","female"
"Wish I could.","SEAN","male"
"We don't need his money Tanya.","SEAN","male"
"What plans? Tell me.","TANYA","female"
"Well it's a nice try. But you can drop the Spartacus routine. I know you, Ron, you've got more class than that.","JACK","male"
"Why?","IAN","male"
"No, you're right.","RONNIE","female"
"No more stolen motors.  No cut and shuts - you want to kill someone else, do you?","PHIL","male"
"That you've got to give us some time Dad! You can't have it all back. People have got to","BRADLEY","male"
"Alright Peggy, I'm gonna go.","RONNIE","female"

"But my mouth's gone all dry.","HEATHER","female"
"I said I'm sorry.","ROXY","female"
"That's probably your mum.","BRADLEY","male"
"Maybe you could come round to Dot's one night.  You could cook something and I could show you how to serveit.","CLARE","female"
"I'll get it.","TANYA","female"
"When was the last time we had any time together?","JANE","female"
"What?  Like, fashion?","STEVEN","male"
"Whistling merrily? Spontaneous acts of affection? Sounds like another woman to me!","CHRISTIAN","male"
"Okay.","CHRISTIAN","male"
"I can't imagine what you're going through. I mean I know Max has already grounded Lauren, but I wouldn't want the kids out anyway, not now.","TANYA","female"
"Well i'ts me that's been sending you the texts.","CLARE","female"
"Good lad. We'll talk again in the morning.","PHIL","male"
"OK. If you're sure.","JACK","male"
"Maybe I should go.","TANYA","female"
"What the date on that?","JACK","male"
"She's not hurting anyone.","STEVEN","male"
"Yeah? What do you think of the lamb?","TANYA","female"
"Brilliant?","STACEY","female"
"That's okay, isn't it?","TANYA","female"
"In little pots.  People love that sort of thing. It's ironic.  Remember? Post-modern, self-referencing....Just, leave it with us...","CHRISTIAN","male"
"Yes.  We'll be free.","SEAN","male"
"Feels like that's all I do sometimes, keep the peace between Lucy and her dad. But I guess that happens in all families eh?","JANE","female"
"Yeah well he left a while ago.","JACK","male"
"","STACEY","female"
"I knew I could count on you.","MINTY","male"

"No. You can't stop him. Getting away isn't enough anymore.  I'm sick of Max always controlling me, you know, always winning. I want to destroy him.  I want to take away everythinghe's ever  cared about forever. There's only one way of doing that - we're going to kill him.","TANYA","female"
"Exactly. I'm going for a wee.","STACEY","female"
"I'm sorry.","RONNIE","female"

So why don't you phone your bent solicitor Ritchie Scott and start saving yourself while you still can.","JACK","male"

"Minty, come on... That's just brilliant.","GARRY","male"
"...  Yeah She's young and stupid... ...Not a sackable offence is it? You don't want to be too hard on your little employee. I mean we've all been there ain't we eh? Caught up in the fantasy. Getting off on the attention...  And Max is an expert at selling the dream...","TANYA","female"
"What do you think you're doing?","JACK","male"
"Glutton for punishment, that's all.","STEVEN","male"

"I'd have drunk it.","RONNIE","female"
"Thank you for talking to Jack and setting this up.","CLARE","female"
"She probably doesn't want to throw a party anymore than you want to go to one. But if she spent the day sitting at home with the curtains drawn like you, then she'd be letting them win, wouldn't she?","CLARE","female"
"But I didn't did I? I didn't have the guts to go through with it.","TANYA","female"
"Well I've been through a divorce remember. From my experience - watch your back.","JACK","male"
"Marriage is about love. About two people taking a chance on each other.  Not this.  You obviously haven't got a clue.","GARRY","male"
"You are lucky I'm off out to have a skin-full of very expensive wine tonight.","ROXY","female"
"What moment's that then?","RONNIE","female"

"Stop worrying about me.  It's about time we all moved on.  That's what families do, innit?","TANYA","female"

"No actually I'm here to stay.","SEAN","male"
"Karaoke machine. ‚","MINTY","male"
"So?  You weren't seriously suggesting...","CLARE","female"
"I ain't inviting her.  Alright, meet me outside. So Heather gets a chance to say thank you, for finding the magazine. I won't hear the last of it otherwise.  Eight o'clock.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Alright mate, alright. Where you going?","GARRY","male"
"Oh don't sugar coat it, will you.  I mean I dunno what's wrong with me? It's like I'm not in control of my own life anymore. And now the girls know about Sean...","TANYA","female"
"Here you go, extra beans","IAN","male"
"You wouldn't have rather gone out for a bite?","MAX","male"
"Nah, but even still, a three course meal....","IAN","male"
"No, you don't understand.  I'd go mad.  I'd kill her.  I'd kill all of you, I know I would -","ROXY","female"
"Right.  Come on.  See you later Gilbert.  Go straight there eh?","MAX","male"
"Running around the Square, breaking hearts all over the place.   Just like his old man.","IAN","male"

"No he wouldn't.And like you say, it's on your terms now.","JACK","male"
"Yeah in here.","IAN","male"
"It's funny you know, before all this I thought I was alright at knowing who to trust. Max has taught me different.   Took him months,","TANYA","female"
"Oi will you two pack it in.  You're giving me a headache. Alright?","PHIL","male"
"I'm going to go back and start preparing the club.  Why don't you stay here for a bit?  Talk me up.  I think I need it.","JACK","male"
"Anywhere.  Away from people suddenly concerned about my welfare!","SHIRLEY","female"
"Yeah. Funny thing is, no sign of forced entry.","TANYA","female"
"Well I've got enough enemies around here. I don't need another.","PHIL","male"
"You'll survive.","PHIL","male"
"I'd love Christian to stay. But we just haven't got the room love.","IAN","male"
"Stuff all those olives personally, did he?‚","JACK","male"
"I'm fine.","RONNIE","female"
"I know that.","RONNIE","female"
"It's nothing. Honest.","STEVEN","male"
"Yeah, same again thanks.  Mum, this is Roger. The bloke who sold me the gear.","STACEY","female"
"Phil thinks you set him up.  That you knew Louise had a step-dad.","RONNIE","female"
"About this party...The girls told me. D'you think it's a good idea? I mean, Oscar's only two months old.  And the girls, they shouldn't be around all that booze.","MAX","male"
"An appropriate outfit.  Do you work in a lap dancing club?","IAN","male"
"Your old man oversleep this morning?I'm expecting an important delivery.","IAN","male"
"The point is I saw you with Ronnie when I told you to stay away from her.","ROXY","female"
"I don't believe","RONNIE","female"
"Bradley about?","CLARE","female"
"What do I want?  I want to talk about Sean.No Max?","STACEY","female"
"I'm having a really bad day, Phil, please.","GARRY","male"
"Yeah I know.  We're trying to get rid of her, but Heather wants her to stay.","MINTY","male"
"Hi, nice to meet you.","CHRISTIAN","male"
"I know.  Now Ian come on. Everything's going to be alright. It is. It's going to be alright.","JANE","female"
"Midnight and I've got no-one to kiss.","ROXY","female"
"He'll pay for this.","RONNIE","female"
"Come on. I thought you were the original party girl.","RONNIE","female"
"What are you still doing here?","TANYA","female"
"It's not happening either.","JACK","male"
"Morning gorgeous.  You alright?","MAX","male"
"Don't wait up.","CHRISTIAN","male"
"I had to, right. He was about to walk. It was the only way I could make him sign 'em. I'm sorry.  We're free now. You can book the flights, cos we're leaving.","TANYA","female"
"I'd rather you left.","TANYA","female"
"Yeah well, I'm sorting out all the paperwork, it's not going to happen overnight is it?","MAX","male"
"You have to be organised in business.","JANE","female"
"There's a half naked man in our house. I think he's got something to do with your brother!","IAN","male"
"Your mate did that.  Ex-mate.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Alright.  I'm sorry.  I just can't handle him being around you all the time.  I know what's going through his filthy little mind Tanya and it's killing me!","SEAN","male"
"I like you the way you are.","MINTY","male"
"Gone?  Alright, well where's he gone and when's he back?","SEAN","male"
"Mum, stop!That's really kind and everything but....","STACEY","female"
"And this is important to me.  It's the start of my new company. And my once in a lifetime chance perhaps of meeting the Queen of England.","IAN","male"
"Dean shown up yet?","SHIRLEY","female"
"It was never my dream Heather. I just want my mate back.  Now if you'll excuse me....","GARRY","male"
"You said you were clean.","TANYA","female"
"Oh, did I screw everything up?","ROXY","female"
"The less you know the better.","TANYA","female"
"Just away for a few days. I wanted to clear my head.","RONNIE","female"
"Yeah, if you want someone that'll stand around rabbiting all night.","JANE","female"
"No, how could he..?","RONNIE","female"
"Offer gratefully accepted.","JANE","female"
"No no, I don't think that's a good idea.","MINTY","male"
"Now this is what I call a party.","CHRISTIAN","male"
"No.","IAN","male"
"Well I weren't the only one who had to sit through it, was I? It weren't just me who had to watch him begging her.","TANYA","female"
"I trust him one hundred per cent. I'm not gonna to let some petty macho rivalry get in the way of what we've got.","RONNIE","female"
"For Phil's sake, for Auntie Peggy's sake, for everyone's sakes, let's just forget about this okay?","RONNIE","female"
"Wish someone would answer mine, I tell ya.  Oscar never settles. I hardly ever see the girls anymore. And now I'm short staffed at the salon. Can't cope with much more.","TANYA","female"
"What?","MINTY","male"
"Won't happen again.","JACK","male"
"It's cool, I'll look after her.I've been looking for a reason to get out and I'm not big on roller coasters.  I'm just going to stay here, do a bit of surfing.    Check my e-mails.  You guys go, have a good time.","STEVEN","male"
"No not really.","STACEY","female"
"So when does Max move back in?","SEAN","male"
"Good enough for her Majesty?","JANE","female"
"Babysitting a bunch of fourteen year olds?  No I'm alright thanks.","STACEY","female"
"West Ham!  Even I knew that.","SHIRLEY","female"
"We've had a lot on, haven't we.  I just haven't had a chance.","TANYA","female"
"Ian, I'll come with you, cos Bobby's on a play date.","JANE","female"
"yeah of course, he likes older men, so if anyone should be worried...","JANE","female"
"Look, I'm not judging you.  If anything, I'm impressed, the more I hear.","CLARE","female"
"What's he got on you, Jase?","JACK","male"
"Maybe not, but after all the stupid things I've done, you've never let me down.   It's funny, sometimes I think we're meant to be mates.","HEATHER","female"
"Yeah, it's hard work coming third.","MAX","male"
"I'm not even sure he likes dancing.  In fact I've heard him say.","HEATHER","female"
"I don't want to sit in some crummy place surrounded by losers.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Well, there's no point in making yourself ill is there?","MINTY","male"
"Meaning if you can't keep your foul mood in check then maybe I should see him alone.","JACK","male"
"You're wasting your time.","ROXY","female"
"I just don't want him living here. Alright?","SEAN","male"
"Yeah, I'm trying it out, what d'you think?","GARRY","male"
"On my life.","MAX","male"
"My sister ain't going out with Ian Beale.","ROXY","female"
"How about you? How are you holding up?","JANE","female"
"Lucy...? ‚ I think giving school a miss on Monday's probably not such a good idea.I mean we can still go to the theme park on Sunday. But Monday... I think we should try and things back to normal.","IAN","male"

"He's coming later.","TANYA","female"
"","TANYA","female"
"No.","STACEY","female"

"Yeah, you have, only I'm trying not to use it in front of Bobby.","JANE","female"
"Nice uniform.","CLARE","female"
"Change of plan.","RONNIE","female"
"Look sorry to interrupt, but is Peggy in?","CLARE","female"

"Hiya. I didn't realise you were going out. I'll um, come back later?","IAN","male"
"Just want Ben.","TANYA","female"
"He's a psychopath.","MAX","male"
"You're wasting your time.","MAX","male"
"Look, I know you WANT to hate me, alright. 'Cause that way you can get away from all this. Right.  And I hate myself. I do. But I have got no choice.","TANYA","female"
"Yeah well you won't have to. Coz I'm gonna do that for you.","SHIRLEY","female"
"Come on, come on, come on.  Shhh.  I know you're scared. I know you're scared. But I'm not. I can deal with Max.","SEAN","male"

And I'll come and visit you every week, but things are gonna have to change between us, because you haven't been treating me right and I deserve better. And it wasn't my fault that Dad left us!
